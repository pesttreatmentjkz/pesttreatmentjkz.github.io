The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
