<p>The objective of development must be to protect and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal usage of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. Documents would be challenging to obtain even if concerted efforts were made due to the several possible causes for long-lasting and brief symptoms and illnesses related to exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>There is no clear clinical proof that consuming crop items stemmed from genetically engineered plants has actually triggered damaging results to human beings or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has actually been for some time, produced with genetically engineered bacteria).
