It is very important that we develop a more active approach that seeks to comprehend natural enemies and how they operate as a part of the ecosystem and to promote their efficiency by use of habitat management (landscape ecology) and other cultural management methods.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents.
