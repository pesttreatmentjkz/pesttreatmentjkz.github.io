<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a duration of about ten years, primarily among researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are often monocultures, including a single crop types, which creates a homogenous habitat typically lacking key requirements of natural enemies, therefore preferring pest types.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though contested by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the increase of pest control.</p>

Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance. </p>
