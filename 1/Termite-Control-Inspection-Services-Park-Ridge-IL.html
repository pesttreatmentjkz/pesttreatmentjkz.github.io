<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has remained in practice for a long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt contaminants are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and additional feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is also based on semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are pushed back or deterred away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Many pesticide problems are caused by a little number of the pesticides readily available today. </p>
