<p>Pest management needs a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had actually reached a financial threshold level. Many private commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in minimal areas.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, eco-friendly and social consequences 13 and is applicable to the majority of agricultural, public health and amenity pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>It is an environment method to crop production and security that integrates various management techniques and practices to grow healthy crops and minimise making use of pesticides.

<p>Well-informed field crews will be able to monitor and identify pest issues and efficiently perform the management methods. The principle of integrated pest management (IPM) originated nearly 60 years ago in response to these unfavorable impacts of pesticides. Numerous of the resources noted at the end of this leaflet can be used for identification of insect pests impacting collections. </p>
