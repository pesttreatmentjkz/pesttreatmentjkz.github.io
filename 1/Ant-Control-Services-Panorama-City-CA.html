It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides might be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits change for modifications in market value, phase of crop development, cost of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based upon fixed invasion or damage levels.</p>
<p>When kept for a long time, kept item pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food product.
