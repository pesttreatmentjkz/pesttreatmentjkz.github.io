<p>Throughout several outreach meetings and field trips arranged solely for the general public in Southern California during the past few years, it appeared that a majority was not knowledgeable about farming systems, had misinterpreting about sustainable agriculture, and thought that natural food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished study information).</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care products are most efficient when they are used properly. You can go with organic chemical treatments, with botanic or fermented items used to get rid of pests. A resistant range might be less chosen by the bug pest, negatively impact its typical advancement and survival, or the plant might tolerate the damage without an economic loss in yield or quality.</p>
