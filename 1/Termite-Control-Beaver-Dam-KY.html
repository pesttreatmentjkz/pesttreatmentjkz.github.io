	<meta name="description" content="Pest Control Spiders in Beaver Dam KY - Potential problems include pesticide resistance, resurgence of insect pests, pesticide poisoning, environmental toxicity, elimination of predator species, negative outcomes for other non-target organisms, disruption in the food web, increased prevalence of pesticide residues in food, and reduced rice yields ( Aktar et al., 2009 ; Sharma et al., 2015 ). These problems could be avoided by implementation of well-designed IPM strategies ( Mohd Fuad et al., 2012 ; Srinivasan, 2012 ; Sharma et al., 2015 ).
