There are 3 categories of biopesticides. In food processing environments, quality pest control is a must. A few of these factors are intrinsic to crop production while making the environment less beneficial for survival, growth and recreation of pest types.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
