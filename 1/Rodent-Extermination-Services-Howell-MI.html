<p>For some tasks, pest control workers use a mix of pest management methods, a practice called integrated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest advantages of natural techniques is that they don't involve making use of toxicchemicals.
