<p>The aim of development should be to safeguard and where possible increase production of healthy food per hectare, with very little use of artificial fertilizer and chemical pesticides. Paperwork would be tough to get even if concerted efforts were made due to the multiple prospective causes for long-term and brief illnesses and signs related to direct exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, ecological and social consequences 13 and applies to a lot of farming, public health and amenity pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and minimize danger from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that reduces overall financial, health, and ecological risks.</p>
