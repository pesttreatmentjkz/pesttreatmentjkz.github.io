<p>Sadly, the greater Tampa Bay location is home to plenty of spiders, and you have likely stumbled upon them inside your home. Think about alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Recent quests for effective, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mostly towards advancement of new and better products with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>Contact the U.S. EPA and your state pesticide regulatory agency with any concerns about the approval status of dicamba herbicide products for in-crop use with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans or products with XtendFlex ® Technology.
