D's has actually been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment.

Safety- People do not understand what safety measures and treatment should follow while using chemicals for pest control. Diseases brought on by pests are promoting the need for various pest control approaches such as biological, mechanical, and chemical methods, thus enhancing growth.</p>
<p>In referral to the principle of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later expanded to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
