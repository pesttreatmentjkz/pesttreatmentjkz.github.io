<p>When other control approaches have failed or are inappropriate for the situation, chemicals might be used in least unstable solutions in targeted locations to deal with the particular pest. Our very own proficient and trained exterminators perform the general pest control to achieve 100% consumer satisfaction. A 2006 US Geological Study evaluation of 51 studies over 10 years reported that 96% of fish, 100% of surface water, and 33% of significant aquifers sampled from 1992 to 2001 consisted of one or more pesticides.</p>
<p>When kept for a long time, stored product pests are most likely to be in a food component on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food item. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of need, is not IPM.
