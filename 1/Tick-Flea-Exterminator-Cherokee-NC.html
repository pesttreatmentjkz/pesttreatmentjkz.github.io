<h2>How To Choose a Reliable Pest Control Service in Cherokee</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Below ground termites live underground and build tunnels, also described as mud tubes", to reach food sources. The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a duration of about ten years, mainly among scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses.
