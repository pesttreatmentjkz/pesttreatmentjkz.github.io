Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines different kinds of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional artificial pesticides-- in a practical, long-term plan. Biopesticides are generally compatible with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Stored product pests are probably to be in a food ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food when stored for a long time.
