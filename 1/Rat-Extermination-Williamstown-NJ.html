<p>Consider alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Current missions for effective, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward advancement of new and better products with which to change conventional hazardous pesticides.</p>
<p>Throughout our mission for alternative pest control steps, the IPM concept has by far gotten the most attention as a thorough pest management approach. Fogging of pesticides should never ever be utilized in a collections institution. Refer to the Woody Ornamental Insect, Mite, and Disease Management Guide, released by Penn State Extension, or to another current reference for a list of materials that are signed up for use on plants in your state.</p>
<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are immense straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not mix pesticides.
