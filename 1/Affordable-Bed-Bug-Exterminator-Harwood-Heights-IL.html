<p>The method to be selected for IPM depends upon numerous factors, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic aspect of the management.

<p>Integrated pest management indicates cautious factor to consider of all readily available plant defense methods and subsequent integration of suitable steps that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep making use of plant security items and other types of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically warranted and decrease or reduce risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>Pests that follow a specific seasonal pattern can be controlled by changing planting dates. The addition of insulation into the attic and walls of a structure can offer control of common pests in addition to understood insulation advantages such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic noise cancelling homes. Recognition of pest risk warrants taking correct steps to get rid of dangerous pests, combining different techniques and eliminating the chemical control repercussions.</p>
