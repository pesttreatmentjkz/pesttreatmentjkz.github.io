<p>For some jobs, pest control employees use a mix of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, diseases, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the increase of pest control.</p>
