The success of control strategies need to be measured utilizing indicators based on monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and effect on the environment.

<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. As soon as monitoring, action, and identification limits indicate that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer effective or readily available, IPM programs then assess the appropriate control method both for effectiveness and threat. The letter of invitation for this plenary address recommended for its title the main theme of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
