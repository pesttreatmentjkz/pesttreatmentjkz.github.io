<p>An extensive understanding of basic IPM concepts and various management alternatives for all possible pest problems is important as some are preventive and others are curative. We usually suggest pest control chemicals that do the job using the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last resort). These prevention and control tactics include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative approaches.</p>
<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and minimize danger from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that lessens total economic, health, and ecological risks.</p>
