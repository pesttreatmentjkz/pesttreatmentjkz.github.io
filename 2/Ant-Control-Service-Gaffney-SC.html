<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
