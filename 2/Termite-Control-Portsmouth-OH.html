<h3>Control Of Termites Portsmouth Ohio</h2>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply selected biopesticides with low ecological effect. Expert exterminators use different types of baits and pesticides to kill and eliminate pests.
