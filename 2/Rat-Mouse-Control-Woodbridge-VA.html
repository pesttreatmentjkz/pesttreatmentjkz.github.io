<p>Termites are such harmful pests that you desire your termite treatment to result in termite extermination.

The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the central style of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, spiders, and termites have developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (girl finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger environment and handles both with the huge image in mind.</p>

Earlier models of integrated pest management (IPM) concentrated on environmental elements of pest management.</p>

The plant science industry, represented by CropLife International, offers a wide variety of appropriate innovations, services and products that can be integrated into IPM techniques.
