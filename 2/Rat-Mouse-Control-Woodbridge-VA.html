The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the central style of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, spiders, and termites have developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (girl finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger environment and handles both with the huge image in mind.</p>

Earlier models of integrated pest management (IPM) concentrated on environmental elements of pest management.</p>
