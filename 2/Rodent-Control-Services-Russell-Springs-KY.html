In the last couple of years, pest control has ended up being more technically involved, with licencing and limitations on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi states.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore associated with "suitable."

<p>Concurrently, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are fended off or hindered away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ).

<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in natural farming may control some pests, but can adversely affect natural opponents and trigger other pests to proliferate (MarkÃ³ et al. 2008 ).

Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative influence on the environment.</p>
