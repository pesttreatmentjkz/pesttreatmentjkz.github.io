<p>Integrated pest management means careful factor to consider of all offered plant protection techniques and subsequent integration of proper procedures that discourage the advancement of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection items and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and decrease or minimise threats to human health and the environment.</p>
