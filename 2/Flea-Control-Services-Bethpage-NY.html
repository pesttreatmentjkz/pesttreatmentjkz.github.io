Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic technique to sustainable crop security that concentrates on managing insects, weeds and illness through a combination of cultural, physical, chemical and biological approaches that are cost efficient, socially acceptable and ecologically sound.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the expense of the control steps.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for water, soil, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole location.
