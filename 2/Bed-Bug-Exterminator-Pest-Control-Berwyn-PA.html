However, some practitioners translate IPM as rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups to keep pest control efficacy and lower pesticide resistance with an emphasis on decreasing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized versus specific soil pests, bacteria, and viruses versus pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungis are effective versus a range of pests.</p>
