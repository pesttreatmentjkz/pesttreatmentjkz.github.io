Chemical control generally refers to the use of synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). Nevertheless, to be technically accurate, chemical control should include synthetic chemicals in addition to chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al.
