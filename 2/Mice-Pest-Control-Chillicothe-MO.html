<p>Pest control is a very crucial step owing to the reality that a number of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control experts frequently utilize pheromones traps as a way to keep track of pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
<p>A biological control program can be successful if these suggestions are followed: 1) correctly determine all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a dependable biological control provider, 3) make certain there is a consistent supply of high quality natural opponents, 4) highlight that correct shipping procedures be followed, and 5) obtain instructions from biological control suppliers on proper release rates and timing of application.</p>
