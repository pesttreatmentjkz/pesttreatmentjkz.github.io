<p>Action Pest Control offers detailed bed bug control services including evaluations performed by highly trained bed bug canines and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug specialists. With more regulations on pesticide use and a decrease in the variety of active components in some crops, there is a greater focus on better understanding of available control choices (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulatory standards that limit the use of certain pesticides or promote making use of others can have a significant influence on IPM execution.</p>
