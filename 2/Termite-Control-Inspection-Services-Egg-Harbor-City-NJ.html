Diseases, insects, and weeds can trigger permanent and pricey harm to animals and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic manufacturers, formulators, service, providers, and providers.</p>
<p>There are more than 40,000 companies dealing with these services and products worldwide, thus causing a highly fragmented competitive landscape. The launched sterile insects need to not be safe or hazardous to humans and the environment. Red weaver ants, here feeding upon a snail, have been used to control pests in China, Southeast Asia and Africa for lots of centuries.</p>

Farmers are faced with myriad of production challenges where the most typical issues are pests, that include diseases, weeds, and insects.
