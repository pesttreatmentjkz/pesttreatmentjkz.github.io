D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level.

If additional monitoring, recognitions and action thresholds show that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.
