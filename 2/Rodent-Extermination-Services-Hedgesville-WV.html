D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Many private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal locations.</p>

<p>If left to their own devices, pests can become an expensive issue for your business. If additional monitoring, recognitions and action thresholds show that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.
