<p>Location under pome IPM in western Europe is given up Table 5 Adoption of IFP over a big area has caused promotion of higher requirements of integrated pest management, up to 30% decrease in pesticide usage, and use of environmentally benign pesticides (Cross et al. 1995). This ensures you have your home secured from bed bugs throughout the year.</p>
