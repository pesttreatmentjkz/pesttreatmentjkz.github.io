<p>The term "integrated" was hence associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular tracking indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>Pest control is an exceptionally essential step owing to the reality that a number of pests are carriers of hazardous disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the removal of a couple of pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control professionals often utilize scents traps as a means to monitor pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a brand-new concept. </p>

If more monitoring, recognitions and action thresholds show that less dangerous controls are not working, then extra pest control techniques would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Nevertheless good the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) might be, it is only fair to say that worldwide, its release in agriculture is still in its infancy, and we are a long way from understanding everything that goes on around the crops we grow for food.</p>
