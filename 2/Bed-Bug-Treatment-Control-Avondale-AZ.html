For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although valuable in reducing environmental contamination and safety problems, still does not truly deal with the environmentally based weakness of the traditional pest control technique.</p>
<p>For instance, rodents threaten grain birds, snails and yields damage strawberries, potato beetles attack eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes. In addition to pest control, we also offer incorporated plans to help protect the whole home, consisting of insulation and moisture control services.

<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a lot of the very same ideas as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals.
