<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about lowering pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>At Pest Control Service, we use non poisonous approaches to remove all of your pests and insects.
