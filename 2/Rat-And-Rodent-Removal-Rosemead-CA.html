<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household bug pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about lowering pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the experts.</p>

Outright Pest Management utilizes environmentally friendly products that will not harm family pets or kids. Members of all areas or departments need to be consisted of on the IPPM committee, which monitors the collection of pest tracking information and the application of particular control and prevention programs.</p>
