<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
