Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, flies and bees are typically found pests in our society.</p>
<p>This may consist of the use of numerous pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to hold and bring in pest insects where they can be managed more efficiently and avoid or reduce their movement onto important crops.
